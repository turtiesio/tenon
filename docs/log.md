# Iteration log

Each entry: decision, rationale, measured effect. Reversals and mistakes included.

## 2026-10-27 — day 1: bootstrap

- **Bootstrap compiler in Rust, std only** (per tenon.md §2.6). Straight pipeline:
  `lexer → parser → check (+exhaust) → emit_c (+emit_body)`, plus `interp` as the
  reference semantics. No third-party crates.
- **Builtin API declared once, in Tenon** (`src/prelude.tn`): `extern fn` signatures
  are type-checked like any other function; each backend implements them by
  name. Non-primitive helpers (`map`, `filter`, `lines`, `unwrap_or`, ...) are
  ordinary Tenon. Replaces a hand-written builtin signature table in the checker
  (DRY: one source per fact).
- **No traits yet.** Every type derives equality, ordering, hashing and
  formatting structurally, so generic code needs no bounds. Maps are not
  ordered (trap if compared with `<`). Traits will be added only when a real
  program needs user-defined dispatch (no speculation).
- **Value semantics via refcounting + copy-on-write** in C; `Rc::make_mut` in the
  interpreter. Structs, tuples and non-recursive enums are by-value C structs;
  an enum is boxed only when it can contain itself.
- **Ownership protocol in the C emitter**: expressions yield owned temps or
  borrowed views; parameters are borrowed, results owned; storing retains.
  Borrowed operands are retained when a later sibling expression may mutate a
  local (assignment or `mut self` call), so C evaluation matches the
  interpreter's left-to-right semantics.
- **Statement separators**: newlines end statements (Go-style), except before
  `.`/`else` and inside `()`/`[]`. Measured effect on usability: TBD (study).
- **No shadowing** within a function: fewer subtle mistakes; cost is occasional
  renaming. Revisit with study data.
- **Mistake found by the corpus on day 1**: `tn_read_line` kept a stale index
  after compacting its buffer at EOF → infinite loop on a final line without a
  newline. Fixed; the test runner now kills tests after 20 s.

## 2026-10-27 — fuzzing, first program, linear types

- **Differential fuzzer** (`tools/fuzz.py`): random well-typed programs, interpreter
  vs C. First 100 programs found 3 bugs: user type names colliding with prelude
  type parameters, untyped `NULL` for empty map literals, `-2.abs()` parsing as
  `-(2.abs())`. Fix for the first: **type parameters are one capital letter plus
  optional digits**, and type names may not have that form. Simple, total, and it
  removes a class of ambiguity in owner arguments (`fn Map[K, V].x`).
- **Ledger** (first real program) found: assignments were not allowed as match
  arm bodies (`None => n += 1`); fixed. And in the program itself: recovery must
  rewrite the journal without the torn tail, or the next append is glued onto
  it. Unrecoverable records are archived (`journal.rejected`) before being dropped.
- **Linear/unique types** as a post-typecheck flow analysis (`src/linear.rs`, ~400
  lines): no runtime cost, no change to either backend. Base case for disposal:
  a type's own methods are exempt for `self`. Without modules this is a
  convention, not a guarantee — recorded as a known gap until modules exist.
- **Performance**: wordfreq 2.38x → 1.71x of C (string-identity hash memo, map
  last-hit cache, fused `for w in s.words()`, zero-copy `read_all`, in-place
  `lower`). Remaining gap is the two-level map layout plus two lookups per
  update in the idiomatic program. trees 2.55x → 1.35x (shared nullary variants,
  borrowed match bindings).

## 2026-10-27 — job queue, generic linear safety, modules

- **Job queue** (second program) uses `linear struct Claim`. It needed `map_err` on
  `Result[Option[Claim], _]`, which the first rule (no generic calls with linear
  type arguments) rejected. Replaced the rule with an analysis: a generic function
  accepts a linear argument for parameter P iff its body passes the linear check
  with P assumed linear (cached per function and parameter). `map_err` passes;
  `unwrap_or` is still rejected (it would drop the default).
- **Usability gap noted**: threading a linear value through an inspecting
  function (`let (c2, r) = run(c)`) is clumsy; an inspect-only parameter mode
  would remove it. Deferred until a second program needs it.
- **Modules** (trigger: the checksummed journal was duplicated verbatim in two
  programs). `import name`, `pub` items and fields, `module.item` access, methods
  only in the defining module. Extracted `std/journal.tn`; both programs shrank
  and their transcripts are unchanged. A test found derived formatting leaking
  private fields; foreign types now show private fields as `..`.

## 2026-10-28 — codecs, incident, landing path

- **Derived strict codec** (`encode`/`decode`), triggered by hand-written record
  encoders in three programs. Format = the literal syntax formatting already
  prints, so encoding is free in both backends; decoding is type-directed and
  canonical-only (re-encoding must reproduce the input). Forgery is prevented
  statically: no codec for capabilities, functions, linear/unique types, or types
  with fields the caller cannot see. The three programs lost ~60 lines.
- **Incident: red main.** The codec commit added a prelude `encode` that collided
  with the programs' own `encode`; the commit command piped `./check` through
  `tail`, which hid the failure. Fixed forward within minutes. Smallest fix for
  the class: `tools/land.sh` (the landing path that was missing): rebase on
  origin/main, `./check --fast`, push only on success. Cost: one 30-line script,
  no time added to landing beyond the check itself.
- **Papercut measured three times today**: `{` in string literals starts
  interpolation, so JSON/struct text in tests needs `\{`. Candidate fixes for the
  study to decide: raw strings, or interpolation only with a prefix. Kept for now.
